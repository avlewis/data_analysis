# data_analysis
__Hello! :wave:__ This is just a repo I've put together that I hope will serve as a portfolio for some of the work I've done in the field of data analysis. Listed below is a description of the files included and what their purpose is. 

## Teradata 2017
 
Contains some of the code I wrote for our teams entry into the 2017 Teradata University Data Challenge. 

**Goal:** Analyze Rise Hunger's annual donation dataset to gain insights into any trends, or patterns that would help predict the amount of meals and/or money donated in any single year.

**Result:** Although we did not place in the top 3 of entries, we did earn a spot as a runner up and I was awarded a Teradata University Network scholarship and invited to attend the conference in Anaheim, California. More importantly though this was my first real experience collaborating with a group on a coding project. For many of us, myself included, it was our first experience using a programming language to analyze data. Everything previously had been done mainly using Excel, and while it was a very steep learning curve at first it really opened my eyes to the advantages these languages possess over more casual spreadsheet programs. All in all, it was a great experience and I believe everyone in my group was proud of the work we put together and submitted.

 
 ## MLS_Analysis
Folder containing the final project I completed for Quantitative Analysis course in my last semster of college. Goal was to find a dataset, analyze it using any kind of programming language and just write a report about our findings. Being a realtor allowed me access to our Multiple Listing Service and I thought it would be interesting to conduct some research on a real-world dataset that was so pertininent to the community I was living in and the line of work I was doing. It was definietly a learning experience, and looking back on the code I wrote I definitely had some learning to do but I have to say it was a project I truly worked hard on and was very proud of at the time! 
 
 ## R 
 
 Just some various code files I've written using the R programming language. Most exapmles use MASS & ISLR datasets and their results could be replicated for anyone who is interested. 
 
 ## Python
