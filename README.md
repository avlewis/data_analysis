# data_analysis
just a sample repo to give some examples of code I've written analyzing various datasets for school, hobby

## Teradata 2017
 
Contains some of the code I wrote for our teams entry into the 2017 Teradata University Data Challenge. 
 
 ## MLS_Analysis
Folder containing the final project I completed for Quantitative Analysis course in my last semster of college. Goal was to find a dataset, analyze it using any kind of programming language and just write a report about our findings. Being a realtor allowed me access to our Multiple Listing Service and I thought it would be interesting to conduct some research on a real-world dataset that was so pertininent to the community I was living in and the line of work I was doing. It was definietly a learning experience, and looking back on the code I wrote I definitely had some learning to do but I have to say it was a project I truly worked hard on and was very proud of at the time! 
 
 ## R 
 
 Just some various code files I've written using the R programming language. Most exapmles use MASS & ISLR datasets and their results could be replicated for anyone who is interested. 
 
 ## Python
